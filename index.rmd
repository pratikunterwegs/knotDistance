# Introduction

This is the `bookdown` version of a project in preparation that links high-resolution tracking data from individual red knots _Calidris canutus islandica_ to fine-scale experimental behaviour measurements in captivity, and aims to explore whether free-living movement can be predicted by consistent individual differences.
